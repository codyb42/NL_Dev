## Custom Post Template
This will be used to remove metadata from posts such as author name, category, and date from bottom of post


## Custom Fields
WordPress custom fields are metadata used to add additional information related to the post or page you are editing.

By default, WordPress saves it into two different areas when you write a new post, page, or any content type.

The first part is the body of your content that you add using the post editor.

The second part is the information about that particular content. For example, title, author, date, time, and more. This information bit of the post is called metadata.

WordPress automatically adds all the required metadata to each post or page you create.

You can also create and store your own metadata by using the custom fields.

By default, the custom fields option is hidden on the post edit screen. To view it, you need to click on the three-dot menu at the top-right corner of the screen and select ‘Options’ from the menu.
